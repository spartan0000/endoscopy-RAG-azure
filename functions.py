    - the number of polyps
    - the size of the polyps which is generally reported in millimeters - less than 10mm or greater than or equal to 10mm is a useful cutoff

    - for adenomas - the number of polyps and the size of the largest adenoma, whether there is high grade dysplasia (yes/no), whether the adenoma is tubulovillous or villous (yes/no)
    - for sessile serrated polyps - the number of sessile serrated polyps, the size of the largest sessile serrated polyp, whether there is dysplasia (yes/no)
